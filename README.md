## Description 

The Layout

The HTML file was adjusted. 

The title was changed so people can see the correct title on the page tab. 

The href link for the images was adjusted because it contained /assets but there is no asset forlder in this project. 

I created the nav with the 4 links "about" "work" "contact" and "resume". I choose to display them in a flex. I choose a different color for the hover so it could look different when people hover over htese links with the mouse. 

I then styled it creating variant colors that can be added through out the layout without having to type them every single time I needed to use them. For that to work, I created the root on top of the CSS file with the 4 variant colors I wanted to use at this project. 

I used flex container for the header too. I set their position for "row" so all the links could be side by side and I choose them to be equaly spread in the centre with the same space in between them so they could look organised and even. 

On my HTML file, I choose the give the hero banner a class so It would be easier to style it at my CSS file later. 

I choose to put a background image which would fade nicely with the original image and give it a blue tone to the image to make the page look well designed. 

I set a background image for the h1 with a darker color for the fonts so it could look easier to read.

And the About me section I set the main pixels for top and bottom margin to make sure it looked align and orgamised within the page. 

At the portfolio container I named it a class called "page-section" and again used flex container to display the links and images well. 

inside of this container I named another class called flex-container to display the links and images aligned in boxes. 

I named the very first flex-itme and a first child so I could set a bigger size image for it on top of all the other 4 images.

I gave to all these flex-items a hovering effect so when people hover over these images with the mouse they will be sure the links are working properly. 

I did not use flex for the address and contact details. I simply choose to style them with colors already used on the page and a hover effect over the links as well. 

I used media query to be sure the page was responsive and would adapt well when seen on a mobile device.
